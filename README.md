## Binary Search Algorithm in Java
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Java. Binary Search is a highly efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.

### Project Overview
- Main Class: BinarySearch.java
- Purpose: This project showcases the binary search algorithm's efficiency compared to a linear search. It generates a random array of numbers, sorts it, and then performs both binary and linear searches to find a randomly chosen target number.
- Features:
  Generates a random array of numbers.
  Sorts the array to enable binary search.
  Performs a binary search and measures the execution time.
  Performs a linear search and measures the execution time.
- Usage: This project provides a clear example of binary search implementation for educational purposes.
## How to Use
1) Clone this repository.
2) Open the BinarySearch.java file in your Java development environment.
3) Run the project.
## Key Points
- The project uses the SecureRandom class to generate random numbers.
- It showcases the efficiency of binary search over linear search.
- Execution time is measured for both search algorithms.
- Comments and method names provide clear documentation.
## Future Improvements
- Extend the project by allowing user input for the number of elements in the array and the target number.
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Add more advanced sorting algorithms for comparison.
